# ü§ñ K-Nearest Neighbors for Personality Classification

### üìñ Overview
This exercise demonstrates the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict personality types (Introvert vs Extrovert) based on social media behavior patterns. I've learned to build a complete machine learning pipeline from data collection to model evaluation.

# üéØ Learning Objectives
Through this exercise, I've learned:

* **Data preprocessing** and exploratory data analysis
* **Feature engineering** for social media behavioral data
* **Implementation** of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
* **Model evaluation** using multiple performance metrics
* **Real-world application** of machine learning for personality prediction

üìä Dataset Description
I've worked with a custom dataset containing 100 social media user samples with the following features:


--Table

--

### Dataset Statistics

* **Total samples**: 100
* **Features**: 4 (after removing Name column)
* **Classes**: 2 (Introvert, Extrovert)
* **Training set**: 80 samples (80%)
* **Test set**: 20 samples (20%)

### üîÑ Methodology

**1. Data Exploration**

I've performed comprehensive data analysis including:

```
# Dataset overview
df.head()
df.info()
df['Personality'].value_counts()

# Visualization
plt.hist(df['Number of Friends/Followers'], bins=20)
```

**2. Data Preprocessing**

```
# Remove non-predictive features
df = df.drop('Name', axis=1)

# Separate features and target
X = df.drop('Personality', axis=1).values
y = df['Personality'].values
```

**3. Train-Test Split**

```
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

**4. Model Training**

```
# Initialize KNN classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Train the model
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
```

# üìà Results and Performance
### Model Performance Metrics

Based on the implementation, I've achieved the following results:

### Confusion Matrix
```
Predicted
            Introvert  Extrovert
Actual  
Introvert     8         2
Extrovert     1         9
```

### Key Insights I've Learned:

1. **Social media behavior patterns** are strong predictors of personality
2. **Active users** with high follower counts tend to be extroverts
3. **KNN performs well** on this type of behavioral classification problem
4. **Feature correlations** exist between posting frequency and personality type

### üéØ Personal Predictions
I've tested the model with different personality profiles:
```
# Example predictions
test_cases = [
    [1, 1, 1, 3000],  # High activity ‚Üí Extrovert
    [0, 0, 0, 200],   # Low activity ‚Üí Introvert
    [1, 0, 1, 1500],  # Mixed profile ‚Üí Varies
]

for case in test_cases:
    prediction = knn.predict([case])
    personality = 'Extrovert' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'Introvert'
    print(f"Profile {case} ‚Üí {personality}")
```
